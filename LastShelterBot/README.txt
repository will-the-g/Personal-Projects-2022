This is a project I made in early 2022. This was before I took before any official computer science or coding class, so everything in here is self-taught.
The formatting of the code is definetely not standard as there's multiple classes and functions in the main file that could be in their own files, and I was still self-teaching everything.
This project takes control of the mouse and keyboard to play a mobile game (Last Shelter Survival) in which I'm emulating on my computer using BlueStacks. 
It performs over 30 different functions inside the game. I made an application with a UI so the user can check off what function within the game they want to be automated.
This project uses a lot pyautogui for mouse/keyboard control. Pyscreenshot for taking screenshots inside the game. PyQt5 for UI applications.
In addition, it uses a lot of pytesseract for computer vision; reading words from a screenshot, and detecting colors on the screen to determine the location of certain items within the game.
I started adding a database to save the user's preferences so they don't have to click all the boxes everytime they load the application.
However, I didn't finish it as I dropped the project when the end of my senior year of highschool came around. All of it works, but I never added all the functions I intended to add.
